INSTALL:
1) Clone project into intellij
2) Might need to manually add the libraries in
3) Download rxtx v2.2.
4) Put RXTXcomm.jar in java/jre/lib/ext (actual path will be something like /usr/jdk-xx-xx-xx/jre/...)
5) Put librxtxSerial.so in java/jre/lib/amd64
6) Add your user to both the uucp and lock groups. Log out, log back in after this step.
7) For now since there is no udev rules set up go to /run/. Then run sudo chmod 777 lock
8) In src/Controller.java change PORT_NAME to the location in /dev/ for the arduino. To find this run ls -haltr | grep ttyACM. If you only have one arduino hooked up it should be one of these.
9) In your run settings in intellij make sure your configuration has single instance only checked in the top right. 


Notes:
If you get an issue saying something about permission and the lock you either did not add your self to uucp/lock or you didnt do step 7. You might need to do this on every reboot.


Todo:
- Need to write all those udev rules and perhaps an install script.
- Need to verify that sensor commands are getting properly handled after they get into vehicleserverimpl
- Need to verify sending commands to the eboard works
- Need way to gracefully shutdown the server so the log files get saved properly.
- Need to add the heartbeat check in Controller.java.
